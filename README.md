# tf-text-Parser

## Description

This is a small application to try out a golang UI library, and work on golang a bit.

It's not that great, however it does allow me to easily validate dialogue files.

## Features

- Load in dialogue lines and display them in a similar manner to what's in TF
- Load in entire dialogue files and display the different sections.
- Play through entire dialogue sections and replay lines.
- Modify lines at will and reinsert them into the file.

## Requirements

The [Humble Fonts Gold](https://somepx.itch.io/humble-fonts-gold) "SinsGold" font is required.

## Building

Simply pull and run `go build` to compile this. Run the resultant EXE file to use it.
